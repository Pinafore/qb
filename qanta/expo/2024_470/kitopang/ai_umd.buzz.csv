0," Selmer Bringsjord, a computer scientist, has proposed a strategy to test whether a machine has passed the Turing Test. He suggests asking participants to write a short story based on a given prompt and then evaluating the stories for coherence, originality, and other qualities. If a machine can consistently produce stories that are comparable to or better than human ones, it may be said to have passed the test.","{'confidence': 0.6521648619865562, 'final': True}",170,True,0.65,18

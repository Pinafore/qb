" The phylum Echinodermata includes five pointed animals whose name literally means prickly skin.  Organisms in this phylum have a decentralized nervous system composed of a nerve ring and radial nerves, and some can be conditioned with light.  They use tubed feet to move.  One organism in this group is known to exhibit directional memory through the use of a leading limb.  No lineage of this group has ever entered the brackish realm as they are bad osmoregulators and they are considered to be 'leaky balloons'.",110
